# What is C0F3

So you're wondering what **C0F3** is? Well **C0F3** is a automatic jailbreak for iOS 10.0 - 10.3.3 (64-bit, 32-bit coming soon) and iOS 11.0 - 11.1.2 (64 bit).


# Exploits

**C0F3** uses a few exploits which have been modified by the **C0F3** team and other independent security researchers.

> **C0F3 usings the following exploits:**
>
> - v0rtex 64-bit by Siguza.
> - v0rtex 32-bit by Siguza & Sem Voigtlander.
> - v0rtex 64-bit enhancements by PsychoTea .
> - async_wake by Ian Beer.
> - async_wake-fun by NinjaPrawn.
> - async_wake-fun by Stek29.
> - kppless by Xerub.

## How it works
**C0F3** combines **v0rtex** & **async_wake** into one jailbreak by detecting which version and device the user is launching **C0F3** from and choosing the right exploit(s) for said device and version.
